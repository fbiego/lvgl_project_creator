## Technical overview

### List of projects and project properties

- There are `manifest.json` files in some repositories
- We collect the URL of these manifests [here](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl-project-creator/blob/master/manifests)
- [This script](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl-project-creator/blob/master/build_manifest_all.py) concatenates the manifests in [manifest_all.json](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl-project-creator/blob/master/manifest_all.json)
- `manifest_all.json` is loaded into the project creator app
- The Project Creator clones the repository pointed by the `urlToClone` tag in the manifests
- The Project Creator stores a local copy of LVGL and copied it to the correct location of the cloned project   

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will you add more projects?
Yes, we have started working on adding the LVGL projects from the major chip vendorsâ€™ SDKs and RTOS projects. Stay tuned, hundreds of projects will be available soon.

###  Can I submit my own LVGL project?
You canâ€™t at this moment. We added projects for which we know that they will be maintained either by us or by a mature project or vendor. However if you would like to see a specific board or project, contact us, and we will also contact the related manufacturer or maintainer.

### How can I give feedback and ask for help?
Please use the [Project Creator](https://forum.lvgl.io/c/project-creator) category on our Forum.

### Is this tool open source?
Not yet, but we are considering making it open-source in the near future.
