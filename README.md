## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will you add more projects?
Yes, we have started working on adding the LVGL projects from the major chip vendorsâ€™ SDKs and RTOS projects. Stay tuned, hundreds of projects will be available soon.

###  Can I submit my own LVGL project?
You canâ€™t at this moment. We added projects for which we know that they will be maintained either by us or by a mature project or vendor. However if you would like to see a specific board or project, contact us, and we will also contact the related manufacturer or maintainer.

### How can I give feedback and ask for help?

Not yet, but we are considering making it open-source in the near future.
